# GitHub Issue Workflow

You are an autonomous developer working through GitHub issues. Work with MINIMAL user interaction - only pause when user review/merge is required.

## PHASE 1: Issue Selection
1. Run `gh issue list --state open --limit 10` to show open issues
2. If user provided an issue number, use that. Otherwise, present the list and ask which issue to work on.
3. Run `gh issue view <number>` to get full details
4. Briefly summarize the issue and START WORKING IMMEDIATELY - do not ask for confirmation.

## PHASE 2: Development (AUTONOMOUS)
1. Switch to main branch and pull latest: `git checkout main && git pull`
2. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/issue-<number>-<short-description>`
3. For non-trivial tasks, use EnterPlanMode to plan implementation
4. Implement the solution following CLAUDE.md guidelines
5. Update CHANGELOG.md with the changes
6. Run `task ci` and fix any issues until CI passes
7. Commit changes with descriptive message referencing the issue
8. Push branch and create PR with proper format

## PHASE 3: Automated Testing (AUTONOMOUS)
Automatically test based on the type of change:

**For UI changes:**
- Use dev-browser skill to navigate to the affected page
- Test the specific functionality that was changed
- Take screenshots if helpful
- Document any issues found and fix them

**For API/backend changes:**
- If there's a UI component (like a download button), test it via dev-browser
- Verify the fix works as expected

**For PDF/report changes:**
- Navigate to a scan results page
- Click the PDF download button
- Verify no errors occur

**For form/validation changes:**
- Navigate to the relevant form
- Test with valid and invalid inputs

Fix any issues found during testing, commit, and push.

## PHASE 4: Automated Code Review (AUTONOMOUS)
1. Run Task tool with subagent_type='pr-review-toolkit:code-reviewer'
2. Run Task tool with subagent_type='pr-review-toolkit:silent-failure-hunter'
3. If HIGH priority issues are found, fix them automatically
4. For MEDIUM/LOW issues, use judgment - fix if straightforward, otherwise note them
5. Push any fixes made

## PHASE 5: User Review & Merge (WAIT FOR USER)
Present a summary to the user:
- What was implemented
- What was tested
- Code review results and any fixes made
- PR link

Then say: "PR is ready for your review and merge. I'll wait for the merge to complete."

Wait for merge using:
```bash
while true; do
  pr_state=$(gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json state -q '.state')
  if [ "$pr_state" = "MERGED" ]; then
    echo "PR merged!"
    break
  fi
  sleep 10
done
```

## PHASE 6: Next Issue (AFTER MERGE)
1. Switch to main and pull: `git checkout main && git pull`
2. Check for remaining open issues: `gh issue list --state open --limit 5`
3. If there are open issues, suggest the next one to tackle:
   "Merge complete! Here are the remaining open issues:
   [list issues]

   I suggest we tackle #XX next because [reason]. Should I start working on it?"
4. If user confirms, immediately start Phase 1 with that issue number.

## Important Rules
- Work AUTONOMOUSLY through phases 1-4 without asking for confirmation
- Only pause at Phase 5 for user review/merge
- Always follow CLAUDE.md guidelines
- Never commit directly to main
- Always run `task ci` before creating PR
- Fix issues found by automated testing and review without asking
- Be efficient - don't ask unnecessary questions
